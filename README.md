# NIFTY-stock-price-prediction
Created a Machine Learning model by creating a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) networks.

What is LSTM ?

Long short-term memory is an artificial recurrent neural network architecture used in the field of deep learning. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, LSTM has feedback connections. It can not only process single data points, but also entire sequences of data.

This has been done for three Stocks :

1. ADANIPORTS
2. ITC
3. RAJESHEXPO (not NIFTY)

The model does the following:

1. Analysis and Prediction of stock prices with help of a dataset.
2. Forecasting of stock prices for the next 30 days.
